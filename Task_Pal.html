	<h1><center>Task Pal: A Scheduling Application</center></h1>

	<h2><center>The Issue</center></h2>

	<p>Myself and a team of 4 other UC Berkeley computer science undergraduates wanted to create an application to help individuals with anxiety disorders cope with the stress of scheduling.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h2><center>The Process</center></h2>

	<p>To create Task Pal, I worked with a team of 5 to step through the entire iterative design process until we ultimately reached an end product that we were proud of. I served as the product manager as well as the UX designer (and I helped with some of the back-end as well). I chose the color scheme, designed the logo, and designed all iterations of the user interface while making sure everyone else was on-task. I also conducted a few of the user interviews and made all of the PowerPoint deliverables that are linked to below. </p>

	<p>The full details of our interview process, design iterations, and competitive analysis are laid out <a href="Task_Pal_Final_Report copy.pdf" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h2><center>The Results</center></h2>
	<p>The final product is a schedule management application that syncs with a user's Google Calendar. When users want to input a task, they provide an estimated completion time and a due date, and Task Pal will schedule it automatically - taking into account the user's preferred work habits (saved in settings) - and will also split up long tasks into smaller segments where appropriate.</p>
	<p>Task Pal also checks in with the user when a task nears completion; if the user indicates that they have not finished, Task Pal will reschedule it automatically.</p>

	<p>We did code a fully-functinoal product, but it is not currently live on the Android App Store. Click below to see our final deliverables:</p>
