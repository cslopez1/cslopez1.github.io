	<h1><center>Short-lifecycle Churn Study</center></h1>

    &nbsp;

    <h3><center>The Issue</center></h3>

    <p>
        This was the first study I conducted as a user researcher for Flodesk. Flodesk had never had a researcher up until this point, and this was the study in which I first implemented all research and recruiting pipelines and processes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        As for the main issue that led to this first large study, we knew that monthly subscribers leave Flodesk at their highest rates within their first two months of their subscriptions. This problem led me to formulate these main research questions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Why are monthly subscribers leaving within the first two months?
        </li>

        <li>
            What factors are driving our members to churn during this timeframe?
        </li>

        <li>
            How are our members assigning value to different features, and how are they evaluating key features within Flodesk?
        </li>

        <li>
            And lastly, who are our members? 
        </li>
    </ul>

    &nbsp;

    <h3><center>The Process</center></h3>

    <p>
        To approach these main research questions, I employed an interview study. Talking face to face with users is the most straightforward way to understand the depth behind user behaviors and motivations that quantitative data can’t give you. Although a survey would have given a better look into the population distribution of reasons for churn, since this was the first research study ever conducted at Flodesk, I thought it best to go the qualitative route and uncover as much about user motivations as I could. With these interviews, we were able to uncover incredible detail behind why some users are churning so soon.  
    </p>

    <p>
        For the interviews themselves, I ran twelve 60 minute sessions over the course of two weeks, where the twelve participants were split into three target user groups: current email subscribers (our base tier), current bundle subscribers (our highest tier), and churned users.
    </p>

    <p>
        To recruit participants for the study, since all of the potential participants had been Flodesk users at some point, I used our email marketing platform to reach out to a random sample of current and recently churned subscribers sampled from our database.
    </p>

    &nbsp;

    <h3><center>The Results</center></h3>

    <p>
        The outcome of this study was an initial jobs to be done framework (a list of tasks and motivations users have for using our product), a better understanding of how/where users assign value, and user evaluations of how our product is helping them to achieve those motivations. This helped us understand the core behind why newer users are churning, why paying users are remaining subscribers, and also gave us a better understanding of our user base as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also made several sweeping product recommendations as a result of my findings. They included:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
             Market opt-forms as the best starting point for new businesses.
        </li>

        <li>
             Provide more customized/visible onboarding and learning materials.
        </li>

        <li>
             Do a better job of communicating the value of Flodesk on our site and in our marketing materials.
        </li>

        <li>
            Evolve our payment plan.
        </li>
    </ul>
    

    &nbsp;

    <h3><center>The Impact</center></h3>

    <p>
        As a result of my initial jobs to be done framework and my recommendation to market our opt-in form offerings as a starting point for new businesses, our marketing team adjusted their marketing materials to more greatly emphasize opt-in forms in order to maximize new sign-ups. We also began designing and testing for a mobile form builder in order to appeal more to mobile sign-ups as a result of these recommendations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From my recommendation to create more customized/visible onboarding and learning materials, we began developing an onboarding questionnaire to ease the onboarding process for new users. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From my recommendation to do a better job of communicating the value of Flodesk on our site and in our marketing materials, we underwent an entire website redesign in which we focused more on communicating the details of our product offering suite.
    </p>
    <p>
        And from my recommendation to evolve our payment plan, I initiated a <a href="Pricing.html" target="_blank">large-scale pricing study</a> to investigate potential ways we could go about structuring our pricing tiers.
