		Below are links to several projects that I led during my year and a half at Tableau. It is not an exhaustive list – rather, it contains several large projects that I’m quite proud of as well as several smaller projects that showcase a range of my skills. 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="JTBD.html">Jobs to be Done</a> - Two large-scale, mixed-methods Jobs to be Done studies conducted in previously unresearched product areas.
	    </li>

		&nbsp;

		<li>
			<a href="Web_Page_Redesign.html">Home Page Redesign</a> - Unmoderated user test that compared user opinions of the previous Tableau Public homepage to a prototyped update, spurred by my previous study's recommendation to reconfigure the website. Provided insight into the impact of the update ahead of launch.
	    </li>

		&nbsp;

		<li>
			<a href="Mentoring_A_Designer.html">Product Testing + Mentoring a Designer</a> - Moderated user test that answered foundational questions about users' expectations and mental models of a new product during beginning stages of development. Also an opportunity to mentor a designer interested in conducting their own research.
	    </li>

		&nbsp;

		<li>
			<a href="Persona_Creation.html">Persona Creation</a> - Formulated a set of learner personas based on a literature review of past Tableau and Salesforce research.
	    </li>
