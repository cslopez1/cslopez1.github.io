	<h1>Lacrosse Shaft Design</h1>
	<p>Worked and collaborated with the design team at Alpha Lacrosse to design these lacrosse shafts for the University of California Men's Lacrosse team. Developed several mockups inspired by my on-field experiences, then commissioned the design team to assemble several prototypes. I then surveyed my team officers and captains to determine which design was the most popular. Once a clear winner was established, we initiated production, and they are currently being used by our entire team.</p>
